## The future of software isn’t apps - it’s agents.

MUXI is building an open, developer-first ecosystem for building real, production-ready AI agents – not just wrappers around chatbots. Built on clear principles like modularity, transparency, and declarative design, MUXI makes it easy to create agents that reason, remember, and get things done.

We believe:

- AI should be infrastructure, not mystery.
- Agents should be open, composable, and owned by developers.

> [!NOTE]
> MUXI is in the early alpha stage. As development progresses, we’ll gradually make more of our work public so you can follow along. However, unless stated otherwise, everything here should be considered experimental for now.
