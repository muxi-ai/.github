## The Vision

We believe the future of software is not apps—it’s agents.

Not dashboards, but dialogue.
Not SaaS logins, but intelligent conversations.
Not a chatbot. Not a search box.

**An agent.**

One that remembers, reasons, and gets things done.

MUXI lets you build those agents.

It’s an open, developer-first framework for building and running production AI agents – modular, transparent, and production-ready from day one.

Where most tools are wrappers around language models, MUXI is an opinionated ecosystem for multiplexed intelligence: agents that think, remember, collaborate, and get things done.

## The Core Philosophy

MUXI is built on a few key principles:

- **Open by default**. The MUXI framework is free and open source. You can run it anywhere, modify it however you want, and never need to use our cloud if you don’t want to.
- **Declarative by design**. Agents are defined in plain language (YAML), not boilerplate code. Build powerful workflows without writing full applications.
- **Composable at every layer**. Mix and match memory systems, toolchains, models, and workflows. Build your own integrations or use the growing library of modules.
- **Agent-first architecture**. Everything revolves around agents. These aren’t just chatbots—they’re orchestrators of tools, memory, decision logic, and real-world action.

## What You Can Build

Use MUXI to build...

- Assistants that manage your calendar, email, or personal life
- Research agents that pull, summarize, and decide
- Internal copilots for your team—whether it’s engineering, sales, or ops
- AI-powered SaaS tools
- Multi-agent systems that plan, delegate, and collaborate
- Autonomous systems that run indefinitely
- Entire platforms powered by language models, memory, and interaction

MUXI is a batteries-included framework that scales from solo projects to full-blown AI apps.

## The Manifesto

We believe:

- AI should be infrastructure, not mystery.
- Developers should own their workflows—and the tools that power them.
- The future of software is intelligent, multiplexed, and agent-driven.
- Conversations should replace interfaces. AI should remove friction.
- The web was decentralized. Then centralized. MUXI helps recentralize power in the hands of developers.

The future is multiplexed intelligence.
Let's build it together.
