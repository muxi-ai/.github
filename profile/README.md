# Infrastructure for the next generation of AI agents.

MUXI (/muk-siː/, Multiplexed eXtensible Intelligence) is an open-source project that makes agents native primitives — not ad hoc scripts or chained prompts — but infrastructure-level processes with built-in orchestration, observability, and scale.

## What we're building

Modern AI workflows still treat agents as code patterns or framework constructs. 

We think they deserve their own foundation – a layer where:

- Agents are declared, not improvised  
- Coordination and reasoning aren't bolted on  
- Memory, context, and tools feel native  
- Any model can be used without vendor lock-in  
- The system itself understands how agents operate  

We’re building infrastructure that reflects this philosophy.

## Why this matters

As agents take on more responsibility, they need the same things every other production system relies on – predictability, structure, durability, and clarity. The current ecosystem doesn’t give developers that. We’re working on an alternative.

## What to expect

Over the coming weeks we’ll begin sharing:

- Research notes and architectural concepts  
- Early components and experiments  
- Developer workflows built around agent-native ideas  
- A preview of how this infrastructure fits into real products  

The full project will be released by the end of 2025.
