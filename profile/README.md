# Infrastructure for the next generation of AI agents.

MUXI (/muk-siː/, Multiplexed eXtensible Intelligence) is an open-source project that makes agents native primitives — not ad hoc scripts or chained prompts — but infrastructure-level processes with built-in orchestration, observability, and scale.

## Our creed

**AI infrastructure should be open, not owned by big tech.**

We believe AI systems should be:

- **Self-hostable** - Run anywhere, owned by you
- **Observable** - See what's happening, always
- **Declarative** - Version-controlled and reproducible
- **Open** - No secrets, no lock-in

If you build it, you should control it.

## What we're building

Modern AI workflows still treat agents as code patterns or framework constructs. 

We think they deserve their own foundation – a layer where:

- Agents are declared, not improvised  
- Coordination and reasoning aren't bolted on  
- Memory, context, and tools feel native  
- Any model can be used without vendor lock-in  
- The system itself understands how agents operate  

We’re building infrastructure that reflects this philosophy.

## Why this matters

As agents take on more responsibility, they need what every production system relies on: predictability, structure, durability, and clarity. The current ecosystem forces developers to stitch together 12+ tools. We're building the alternative.

## What to expect

Over the coming weeks we’ll share:

- Research notes and architectural concepts  
- Early components and experiments  
- Developer workflows built around agent-native ideas  
- A preview of how this infrastructure fits into real products  

The full project will be released by the end of 2025.
