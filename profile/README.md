# The Future Is Agent-First

We believe the future of software is not apps – it’s agents.

Not dashboards, but dialogue.
Not SaaS logins, but intelligent conversations.
Not a chatbot. Not a search box.

**An agent.**

One that remembers, reasons, and gets things done.

MUXI lets you build those agents.

It’s an open, developer-first ecosystem for building and running production AI agents – modular, transparent, and production-ready from day one.

Where most tools are wrappers around language models, MUXI is a flexible approach for multiplexed intelligence: agents that think, remember, collaborate, and get things done.

## Core Philosophy

We believe that AI should be infrastructure, not a mystery. We also believe developers should own their workflows and the tools that power them.

MUXI is built on a few key principles:

- **Open by default**
- **Declarative by design**.
- **Composable at every layer**
- **Agent-first architecture**

The future is multiplexed intelligence.
Let's build it together.
